# in this lab i set up "router on a stick" and created two vlans that can communitate
![router on a stick 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/542ae7f2-635b-4d84-82d6-66fd8812c9fc)
##issues i ran into were
- forgetting to set switchport mode access (to enable the vlans)
- having an issue setting a description for the vlan. i learned that you cannon put a space in the description of the name
- i accedently put vlan f2/1 in the wrong VLAN (vlan 20 when it shouldve been VLAN 10)
